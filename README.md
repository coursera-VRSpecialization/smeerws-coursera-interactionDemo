# smeerws-coursera-interactionDemo
 
### Project description: 
This project is part of the coursera course [3D Interaction Design in Virtual Reality](https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-interaction-design-virtual-reality) a VR speczialisation provided by the University of London. The basic scene used for this project I've created in the first course 
[3D Models for Virtual Reality](https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-interaction-design-virtual-reality). If you are interested, you can find the unity project/repository
on [github](https://github.com/coursera-VRSpecialization/smeerws-ARVR-Studio). This project aims toward a simple interactive VR experience that can be viewed in VR. The experience combines an environment and interactive parts like, locomotion and object manipulation. 

### Development platform: 
Windows 10, Unity 2019.1.14f1, Visual Studio community 2017 version 15.9.17, SteamVR Plugin 2.5.0 (sdk 1.8.19), Scripting Runtime Version: .NET 4.x Equivalent

### Target platform: 
Oculus Rift S/Rift/Vive. The VR experience is tested and optimized for the Oculus Rift S platform

### Visuals: 
Screenshots (concept and experience), Video

### Necessary setup/execution steps: 
Installation process, e.g. step by step instructions that I can run the project after cloning it

### Third party material: 
* The used factory environment in this project I've used in another project before:
  * https://github.com/smeerws/VRND-NightattheMuseum

### Project state: 

Peer-graded Assignment: Project Work in Progress

You should submit your work in progress towards creating a simple interactive VR experience that can be viewed through standard VR hardware. If you want to use specific hardware (e.g. 6DOF controllers for VIVE or Oculus) you must make that clear and it may take longer for your project to be marked.

You should submit a unity project with a scene that can be viewed in VR, that represents a real or imaginary environment (it does not have to be realistic, it could be a fantasy or abstract environment) and that has a navigation method.

The requirements are:

- [ ] You should have a brief description of your project
- [ ] This description should give instructions
- [ ] The description should give any restrictions on hardware needed to run the scene
- [ ] The project should contain a simple 3D scene with objects
- [ ] The scene should be viewable in VR
- [ ] You should have a mechanism for moving around the scene beyond the walkable area of your VR set up
- [ ] The movement system should be designed to avoid nausea

### Limitations: 

### Lessons Learned: 
- Create a Unity project
- Implement locomotion in Unity with SteamVR
- Design and implement interactions in Unity for VR
